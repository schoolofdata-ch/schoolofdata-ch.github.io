## Get started

In our Data Expedition, you can learn to work with open data and collect resources for the upcoming [Open Food Hackdays](http://food.opendata.ch). The first step is to register for the workshop at [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.de/e/food-data-prep-expedition-tickets-48829204465). Meanwhile, in the [#Expedition](https://team.opendata.ch/food/channels/expedition) channel of our virtual community (*[sign up here](https://team.opendata.ch/signup_user_complete/?id=d5sor7paep8gtxtbah94yozjea)* to our Mattermost open chat server), as well as through the [discussion forum](https://forum.schoolofdata.ch/t/7-9-9-open-food-data-x-smart-kitchen-hackdays/422), we will be sharing updates on our progress. With these three steps, you too can take part:

### 1. Check Datacentral

<img align="right" style="margin-left:1em; border:1px solid grey" title="Screenshot of Datacentral" src="/images/posts/food-dc.jpg" width="320">
At [openfood.schoolofdata.ch](http://openfood.schoolofdata.ch) ("Datacentral") and [github/foodopendata](https://github.com/foodopendata) you can see the list of datasets already prepared in the form of Data Packages, each in a GitHub repository. Look around to understand what is meant by *Open Food Data*. Think about some questions you would like to ask, issues you care about. Run some additional searches on [data portals](http://opendata.swiss) or [search engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_search_engines). If you have an idea, or find something interesting, hold onto it for the next step.

### 2. Make a suggestion

<img align="right" style="margin-left:1em" title="Angelica by Sylvia Fredriksson" src="/images/camps/Angelica_sm_attributed.jpg" width="320">
Ideas you share by [contacting us](/#contact) or raising an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/foodopendata/food-datasets/issues) will go into a [master list](https://github.com/schoolofdata-ch/food-datasets/blob/master/data/food-datasets.csv). This is a public process and requires some moderation. In particular, we are looking for <u>sources of data which are relatively up to date, with potential for new applications, and which are as free as possible of restrictions and accessibility issues</u> - in the ideal case, open according to the [Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org/). From the best data we discover together, we aim to create as many Data Packages as possible.

### 3. Package the data

<img align="right" style="margin-left:1em" title="Open Food Data logo" src="https://food.opendata.ch/wp-content/themes/food.opendata.ch/images/logo.png">
From the [master list](https://github.com/schoolofdata-ch/food-datasets/blob/master/data/food-datasets.csv) we will download and test datasets, do some minor clean-up if necessary, check the [licenses](http://licenses.opendefinition.org/), [create](http://datapackagist.openknowledge.io/) and [validate](https://http://goodtables.io) a Data Package, and document any issues in a README. Data Packages currently being created or updated that we are [looking for help](https://github.com/foodopendata/food-datasets/issues) with are listed in GitHub:

If there is a dataset you wish to see supported at [github/foodopendata](https://github.com/foodopendata), you can also fork our [boilerplate](https://github.com/schoolofdata-ch/datapackage-boilerplate) and start a Data Package yourself. If you publish it online, send us the URL for feedback and inclusion in the [master list](https://github.com/schoolofdata-ch/food-datasets/blob/master/data/food-datasets.csv) and [Datacentral](http://openfood.schoolofdata.ch).

## Tips and tools

There are lots of resources in our [Forum](https://forum.schoolofdata.ch), and you may also find our data wrangling [Toolbox](http://toolbox.schoolofdata.ch) and information on [Data Packages](http://openfood.schoolofdata.ch/about/) useful. By this time you may have other things to share or ask, so [let's chat](/#contact). Then come to the Hackdays and make something amazing!
