> To those who joined our 1st [School of Data workshop](https://forum.schoolofdata.ch/t/14-1-food-data-expedition/175/1) of the year, spending part of last weekend to explore food-related datasets with us - you were an awesome group to work with, _thanks for coming!_ See [Hackday results](https://hack.opendata.ch/event/6) for a list of Data Packages we produced.

Facilitated by [Oleg](https://forum.schoolofdata.ch/users/oleg), [Heidi](https://forum.schoolofdata.ch/users/heidi) and [Florian](https://forum.schoolofdata.ch/users/florianwieser), we started off our latest session with an introduction to **Open Food Data**, an exciting new program that begins with [hackdays on February 10-11](http://food.opendata.ch).

A brief overview from data literacy to data wrangling followed: we quickly covered the basic ideas, and you can visit the School of Data [**Online Courses** page](http://schoolofdata.org/courses/), as well as [search our forum](https://forum.schoolofdata.ch/c/icanhasdata) for tutorials and more links to explore. Then, we dived in and came up with a big pile of ideas, everyone sharing their topics and interests.

We divided up into three groups around broader themes - roughly: economics, consumption and sustainability - and worked our way through the ideas generated. A [list of relevant datasets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W27W3vuD5mj1CDWbGJhjECabRbsqVzt_8EhPJV1l5b0/pubhtml#) emerged through searching [open data portals](http://opendata.swiss) and the [World Wide Web](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=food+data+filetype%253Axls&ia=web).

Several of these seemed especially promising (in terms of openness, accessibility, usefulness...), so we started creating [Data Packages](http://food.schoolofdata.ch/about/) in view of helping [hackday](http://food.opendata.ch) teams to get started. You can find these at [**food.schoolofdata.ch**](http://food.schoolofdata.ch) - we will continue building up this resource over the weeks ahead, so please keep sending in [your suggestions](https://goo.gl/forms/J5nHDCBvu3VGmonE3)!
