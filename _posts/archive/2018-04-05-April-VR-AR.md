# VR+AR workshop at E-0010
> After a break, the Bern exclusive event featuring new and award-winning short films presented in Virtual Reality (VR) by We Are Cinema will take place again at the [E-0010 space](https://www.effinger.ch/raeume/zweites-ug/). We plan to run a one-day introductory workshop in August about content creation for Virtual and Augmented Reality, in collaboration with partnering institutions interested in these new media.
**We encourage everyone to attend, there are no specific skill requirements**, though some experience with 2D illustration or 3D modelling tools would be an asset.

* _Englischkenntnisse sind in unserem Workshop von Vorteil, aber nicht zwingend. Materialen und Anweisungen sind auch **auf Deutsch** verfügbar._
* _De bonnes connaissances en anglais seraient un atout, non pas obligatoire. On peut fournir sur demande les liens et répondre sur place **en français**._

### Goals

With free tools such as Vizor and A-Frame, you can create your first online 3D project in minutes, even without ever having created a website before. We will demonstrate some advanced tools, such as modelling tools, panoramic photography and videography, and animation engines used to make feature films, and give you time to explore the technology at your own pace.

Check out our **[GLACIER DATA VISUALISATION](https://opendata.utou.ch/aletsch/2018/)** as an example!

Depending on interest levels, we can use the chance to talk about 3D data visualisation, electronic art, motion capture and modelling, 360° photography, and other special capabilities we plan to develop as part of the digital co-creation program for coworkers at Effinger's new underground lab.

At this hands-on full-day(?) event, we will:

- 09:00 start with **TAMING DATA DRAGONS**, brief introductions, and sharing of core concepts and principles
- 09:30 jump into **FINDING RELEVANCE** for exploring my world, my neighbourhood, my self in data
- 10:30 learn to **VISUALIZE OPEN DATA** using free tools, and break the "Chart" button spell
- 12:00 take a **BROWN BAG LUNCH BREAK** for story sharing, networking and nutrition
- 13:00 freshen up with **STATISTICAL ANALYSIS** a brief primer in causation, correlation and fact-checking
- 14:00 go hands on with **BUILD-YOUR-OWN-DATA PROJECTS** and get individualised help in your chosen area
- 16:30 get **FURTHER DIRECTIONS** for deeper learning and connect to online communities of practice
- 17:00 enjoy a **KNIGHTS AT THE TABLE** wrap up with [anniversary^2](https://blog.soda.camp/001/) apéro offered by our hosts

This Data Expedition will be facilitated by:

### Materials

If you bring your laptop, we will help you install free software to start developing VR content on your own. No coding required. But even with just a recent smartphone (iPhone 5 and up, Android "Lollipop" 5+), you can explore this thrilling new medium and upload your own content in virtual spaces.

We will have Google Cardboard, Samsung GearVR and Oculus headsets available. If you have your own device(s), you are of course welcome to bring them with you!

### Costs

We are currently determining whether and what cost applies to participating in this workshop. If you are interested in having your organisation sponsor this event, please contact us.

We are committed to organising accessible public events to as wide an audience as possible. The School of Data in Switzerland is supported by the national association [Opendata.ch](http://opendata.ch), and is run and facilitated by volunteers.

We suggest a [donation of 200.-](http://opendata.ch/spenden) (students/AHV/IV: 50.-) to professionals who benefit from this workshop, and to offset some of the infrastructure costs required. Your support will pay for the next round, as prior participants have paved the way for this one.

Thank you for helping us to ensure high quality public events and open data literacy resources!
