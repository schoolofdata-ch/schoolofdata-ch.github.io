This [Data Expedition](http://schoolofdata.org/data-expeditions/) will begin with a workshop to:

- brainstorm about what information helps us to gain insights into tourism
- present suggested open data sets covering this type of information
- learn to use data wrangling software from our [Toolbox](http://toolbox.schoolofdata.ch)
- collect, validate, clean and prepare data sets for the hackdays
- publish the results online for others to use

We want to involve people with all kinds of skills at this event,
whether you are familiar with the tourism industry,
a data expert or just someone who would like to learn how to work with data.
We will be working in groups and learn from experts and each other.
