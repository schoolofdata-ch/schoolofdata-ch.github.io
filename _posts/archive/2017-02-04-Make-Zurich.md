The [Open Network Infrastructure Association](https://opennetworkinfrastructure.org/), is pursing important next steps in creating data about the physical world - with the capability to do this at scale now possible at a grassroots level and openly licensed.

We supported their first volunteer run event in February - [Make Zurich](http://makezurich.ch/) - with platforms and guidelines, helping to ensure a high quality and innovative event for all participants. On day 2 we ran a workshop talking about data literacy and the resources available at School of Data:

In addition to putting together some sensors of our own, we wanted to collect aggregate data about the use of nodes at the hackathon by sharing device information from the community. [@Oleg](https://forum.schoolofdata.ch/users/oleg/) and [@Heidi](https://forum.schoolofdata.ch/users/heidi/) asked the teams at Make Zurich to share their applications on The Things Network.

This allowed us, in a safe way and without interfering with their projects, to plot the overall activity data from all devices - and make a rudimentary analysis at least only based on timestamps. The result looked like this:

Details and R code [can be found here](https://now.makezurich.ch/project/13)

Furthermore, we started a discussion about the potential of integrating Swagger-based APIs such as the ones used by The Things Network with Data Packages, which we were making at our [previous workshop](https://schoolofdata-ch.github.io/2017/01/14/Food-Data-Expedition.html).

If you have any questions, let's get in touch via [contact form](/#contact) or [public forum](https://forum.schoolofdata.ch/).
