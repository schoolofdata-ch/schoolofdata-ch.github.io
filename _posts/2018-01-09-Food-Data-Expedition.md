Start the new year with a virtual **[Data Expedition](http://schoolofdata.org/data-expeditions/)**, building up on our [workshops last year](/2017/01/14/Food-Data-Expedition.html). Learn to work with open data and to prepare resources for the upcoming [Open Food Hackdays](http://food.opendata.ch).

We wish to involve people with all kinds of skills at this event, whether you are a nutritionist, a data expert or just someone who likes to learn how to work with (food) data. We will be working together online and learning from each other. **Note:** please see registration instructions at [food.opendata.ch](http://food.opendata.ch) to participate in the Hackdays. Registration for the Hackdays is *not* required if you just want to help with the virtual Expedition.

## Let's get started!

With these three steps you too can take part and contribute to the Data Expedition:

### <a href="http://openfood.schoolofdata.ch" class="button special">1. Visit Datacentral &nbsp;<i style="color:#ed0" class="fa fa-lemon-o fa-5" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

<img align="right" style="margin-left:1em" title="Screenshot of Datacentral" src="https://forum.schoolofdata.ch/uploads/default/original/1X/3590c07495ca0ac94761a880f0518d17252c0275.jpg" width="300">
At [openfood.schoolofdata.ch](http://openfood.schoolofdata.ch) (powered by Datacentral) you can see the list of datasets already prepared. Take a look around, and bookmark this page for reference. This may already give you some ideas, so try to run a few searches on [data portals](http://opendata.swiss) or your favorite [search engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_search_engines). If you find something interesting, then share it:

### <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/J5nHDCBvu3VGmonE3" class="button special">2. Make a suggestion &nbsp;<i style="color:#5e5" class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-5" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

<img align="right" style="margin-left:1em" title="Angelica by Sylvia Fredriksson" src="/images/camps/Angelica_sm_attributed.jpg" width="300">
Your ideas go into a [master list](https://github.com/schoolofdata-ch/food-datasets/blob/master/data/food-datasets.csv), from which we work on creating more [Data Packages](http://openfood.schoolofdata.ch/about/). This means that we pick promising datasets, download and clean them, check the licenses, and document any issues we find in a "README". Some example Data Packages can be found in our [GitHub profile](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Adatapackage+org%3Aschoolofdata-ch&type=Repositories). You may find our data wrangling [Toolbox](http://toolbox.schoolofdata.ch) useful. By this time you may have other things to share or to ask, so let's chat:

### <a href="https://enguete.schoolofdata.ch/signup_user_complete/?id=d5sor7paep8gtxtbah94yozjea" class="button special">3. Join the community &nbsp;<i style="color:#ff6943" class="fa fa-cutlery fa-5" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

In the [#Expedition](https://enguete.schoolofdata.ch/food/channels/expedition) channel of our virtual community ([Sign up here](https://enguete.schoolofdata.ch/signup_user_complete/?id=d5sor7paep8gtxtbah94yozjea)) (powered by [Mattermost](https://docs.mattermost.com/overview/product.html#about-the-mattermost-open-source-project)), we will be sharing updates on our progress - as well as later on supporting participants during Hackdays.

*Start the year off with a fresh challenge and make something awesome with open data!*
